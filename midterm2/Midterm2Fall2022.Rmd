## Question 1 (15 pts.)

Let's start by working with the training data to gain some comfort working with the MNIST data.

### Part 1 (5 pts.)

Create a plot that shows 9 random images in the training data. Label each image with its corresponding label. Do the images match the labels?

### Part 1 Solution
```{r}
train_y[50,] #0
plot_digit(x = train_x[50,], bw = FALSE, main = "True Class = 0")
train_y[1500,] #0
plot_digit(x = train_x[1500,], bw = FALSE, main = "True Class = 0")
train_y[2800,] #1
plot_digit(x = train_x[2800,], bw = FALSE, main = "True Class = 1")
train_y[6500,] #2
plot_digit(x = train_x[6500,], bw = FALSE, main = "True Class = 2")
train_y[10000,] #3
plot_digit(x = train_x[10000,], bw = FALSE, main = "True Class = 3")
train_y[13780,] #5
plot_digit(x = train_x[13780,], bw = FALSE, main = "True Class = 5")
train_y[17000,] #6
plot_digit(x = train_x[17000,], bw = FALSE, main = "True Class = 6")
train_y[20000,] #7
plot_digit(x = train_x[20000,], bw = FALSE, main = "True Class = 7")
train_y[23730,] #9
plot_digit(x = train_x[23730,], bw = FALSE, main = "True Class = 9")
```
Yes the images match the labels.

### Part 2 (5 pts.)

For each digit (0 - 9), compute the average within class pixel value for each of the 144 pixels across the training data. Create a plot that shows the 10 average digits. Which class seems to show the most within class variation over images? Which class seems to the least within class variation over images?

### Part 2 Solution
```{r}
mean_train <- matrix(nrow = 10, ncol = 144)
x_split <- seq(1,27500,2500)
for (i in 1:144){
  for (j in 1:10){
    mean_train[j,i] <- mean(train_x[x_split[j]:(x_split[j+1]-1),i])
  }
}
for (j in 1:10){
  plot_digit(x = mean_train[j,], bw = FALSE)
}
```

### Part 3 (5 pts.)

Using the average images, come up with a measure of similarity or dissimilarity between different digits. It doesn't need to be particularly elegant.

Which pairs of digits will be easiest to tell apart? Which pairs will be most difficult? Thinking about how people write different digits, does your similarity measure make sense?

### Part 3 Solution

## Question 2 (15 pts.)

Let's start with one of the digit pairs that is easiest to tell apart: 0s and 1s. For this question, we'll build a classifier to discriminate between images of 0s and images of 1s. Start by subsetting your training and validation data sets to only include 0s and 1s (a literal manifestation of the classification problem).

## Question 2 Data
```{r}
p2_trainX <- train_x[1:5000,]
p2_trainY <- train_y[1:5000,]
p2_validX <- validation_x[1:3000,]
p2_validY <- validation_y[1:3000,]
```

### Part 1 (8 pts.)

For reasons you will soon see, we'll only consider one classification approach for this problem - logistic regression. Using your training data, train a logistic regression classifier for the literal 0/1 problem. Compute an in-sample measure of expected prediction accuracy using the training data. Similarly, compute the accuracy of your trained logistic regression model on the validation set. What do you find here?

Intuitively, explain this result. Think carefully about the how logistic regression is approaching this classification problem.

Plot up to 4 images in the validation set that are misclassified with respect to the Bayes' classifier. Does this misclassification make sense? What about these images leads the classifier to incorrectly guess the proper label?

Note: the underlying algorithm for logistic regression proceeds iteratively attempting to minimize the logistic regression loss function. Because many of the predictors in this problem have variance close to zero, the default number of iterations (typically 25) may not be enough for the algorithm to converge. You can deal with this issue by setting the maximum number of IRLS iterations to a larger value - 100 should be sufficient. In R, this can be achieved within your `glm` call by adding an additional control argument - `control = list(maxit = 100)`.

### Part 1 Solution
```{r}
#logistic regression model
p2_train <- data.frame(p2_trainX, p2_trainY)
p2p1_logistic <- glm(data=p2_train, 
                     formula = p2_trainY ~ .,
                     family = binomial(link='logit'),
                     control = list(maxit = 100))
#in-sample EPE
folds <- create_folds(seq(1,nrow(p2_train)), k = 10, type = "basic")
mis_rate <- c()
for(i in 1:length(folds)){
  countMs = 0
  logistic_cv <- glm(p2_trainY ~ ., data=p2_train[folds[[i]],], trace=FALSE)
  logistic_cv_pred <- predict(logistic_cv, newdata = p2_train[-folds[[i]],], type = "response")
  #classify predictions
  for (j in 1:length(logistic_cv_pred)){
    if (logistic_cv_pred[j] > 0.5) {
      logistic_cv_pred[j] <- 1
    }
    else {
      logistic_cv_pred[j] <- 0
    }
  }
  #Count of Misclassifications
  for (k in 1:length(logistic_cv_pred)) {
    if (logistic_cv_pred[k] != p2_train[-folds[[i]],]$p2_trainY[k]){
      countMs = countMs + 1
    }
  }
  mis_rate[i] <- countMs / length(logistic_cv_pred)
}
p2p1_epe<-mean(mis_rate)
p2p1_epe #0.0036
#oos
countMs = 0
logistic_valid <- predict(p2p1_logistic, newdata = p2_validX, type = "response")
#classify predictions
for (j in 1:length(logistic_valid)){
  if (logistic_valid[j] > 0.5) {
    logistic_valid[j] <- 1
  }
  else {
    logistic_valid[j] <- 0
  }
}
#Count of Misclassifications
for (k in 1:length(logistic_valid)) {
  if (logistic_valid[k] != p2_validY[k]){
    print(k) #misclassified: 271, 1057, 2203, 2259, 2311, 2555
    countMs = countMs + 1
  }
}
p2p1_oos <- countMs / length(logistic_valid)
p2p1_oos #0.002
```
The in-sample EPE and oos PE are both extremely small. Our model has great predictive capabilities.

```{r}
countMs #there are 6 misclassifications: 271, 1057, 2203, 2259, 2311, 2555
validation_y[271,] #0
plot_digit(x = validation_x[271,], bw = FALSE, main = "True Class = 0")
validation_y[1057,] #0
plot_digit(x = validation_x[1057,], bw = FALSE, main = "True Class = 0")
validation_y[2203,] #1
plot_digit(x = validation_x[2203,], bw = FALSE, main = "True Class = 1")
validation_y[2311,] #1
plot_digit(x = validation_x[2311,], bw = FALSE, main = "True Class = 1")
```
The misclassification does make sense, because the ones have a lot of white area around the middle vertical line (when x is 0.4-0.6), and zeros have a lot of gray area around the middle vertical line.

### Part 2 (7 pts.)

Let's try to understand exactly how this classifier is working. For the training data, compute a logistic regression classifier with the LASSO penalty on the coefficients. Use K-fold CV to find a value of $\lambda$ that sparsely represents the set of coefficient and viably minimizes the expected misclassification rate for out of sample data.

Using the coefficients associated with your chosen value of $\lambda$, create a plot that shows the relationship between the pixels and the coefficients. Positive coefficients are associated with pixels where a pencil pixel in that location (value \> 0) **increases** the predicted probability that the image is a 1 while negative coefficients are associated with pixels where a pencil pixel in that location (value \> 0) **decreases** the predicted probability that the image is a 1.

Leveraging this plot, come up with a set of rules related to the location of pencil pixels that a human who had the pixel mappings could evaluate to determine if an image is a zero or one. The rules don't need to exactly relate to specific pixels. Rather, they can relate to relative location of the pixels (center vs. noncenter, for example).

This task is, more or less, an example of **computer vision** - trying to use classification methods to make computer view images in the same way as humans.

```{r}
#LASSO
p2p2_trainX <- data.matrix(p2_trainX)
p2p2_trainY <- data.matrix(p2_trainY)
#scientific lambda
p2_cv_lasso <- cv.glmnet(x=p2p2_trainX, y=p2p2_trainY, family="binomial",
                     control = list(maxit = 100), alpha=1, nfolds=10,
                          type.measure="mse")
#our chosen value of lambda is
p2_cv_lasso$lambda.min
p2_lasso <- glmnet(x=p2p2_trainX, y=p2p2_trainY, family="binomial", alpha=1,
                            lambda=p2_cv_lasso$lambda.min)
p2_lasso$beta #coefficients
p2_corr <- c()
for (i in 1:length(p2_lasso$beta)){
  if (p2_lasso$beta[i] > 0) {
    p2_corr[i] = 1
  }
  else if (p2_lasso$beta[i] < 0) {
    p2_corr[i] = -1
  }
  else {
    p2_corr[i] = 0
  }
}
cf1 <- c()
cf2 <- c()
for (i in 1:59) {
  cf1 <- append(cf1, rownames(p2_lasso$beta)[i])
  cf2 <- append(cf2, unname(p2_lasso$beta)[i])
}
cf <- data.frame(cf1, cf2)
ggplot(data=cf, aes(x=cf1, y=cf2)) +
  geom_bar(stat="identity", width=0.75) + coord_flip() +
  labs(x="Features", y="Coefficient Estimate") +
  theme_bw() +
  theme(plot.title = element_text(hjust = 0.5), 
        axis.title.x = element_text(face="bold", colour="red", size = 12),
        axis.title.y = element_text(face="bold", colour="red", size = 12))
```

## Question 3 (25 pts.)

Now, let's work with a more difficult pair - 4s and 9s. Logically, these are going to be more difficult to distinguish! Start by subsetting your training and validation sets to only include 4s and 9s. There may be some situations where you need to recode these to zeros and ones! When making predictions on the test set, be sure to recode the predictions back to 4s and 9s.

### Part 1 (5 pts.)

Start by replicating your analysis for 0s and 1s using logistic regression for 4s and 9s. Compute an in-sample measure of expected prediction accuracy and find the misclassification rate for your validation set. How does this compare to the performance of logistic regression for 0s and 1s? Why do these results differ?

Using the same LASSO approach as above, create a plot that shows which pixels are important for the classification. How does this image differ from the 0/1 case?

### Part 2 (5 pts.)

Compute QDA and Naive Bayes classifiers for the 4/9 problem. Compare their performance on the validation set to your logistic regression. What's going on here? Why do we see what we see? Think carefully about the assumptions under-the-hood for QDA, Naive Bayes, and logistic regression and the structure of the pixel data in the MNIST data set. You can apply the logic of your findings from this part to the rest of the assignment!

### Part 3 (10 pts.)

Using the full suite of classification approaches discussed in class, find a classification approach that **minimizes** the expected misclassification rate of 4s and 9s on a true out of sample data set.

Your answer should discuss the possible approaches to this problem and explain how you made your final choice. Discuss how you chose any tuning parameter values.

You do not need to run all possible classification methods to get full credit for this question! There are some methods that we can rule out without ever running them. When doing this, provide grounded reasoning related to the strengths and weaknesses of different approaches.

For your chosen method, explain **why** it outperforms all other approaches. Think carefully about strengths and weaknesses.

Finally, present at least 4 examples of misclassified images. Could we ever expect a classification algorithm to get those images correct?

### Part 4 (5 pts.)

Use the hidden test set to generate a prediction for each included image. Your predictions should be stored in a matrix that has the image key as the first column and the integer value of the class in the second column. Save this matrix as `Q3Predictions.csv` and include it with your final submission.

Points for this question will be given with respect to classification accuracy. Let $E_i$ be the proportion of observations in the test set (that are actually 4s and 9s) that are correctly classified. Let $E_{max}$ be the maximum proportion of correctly classified observations across the class. Then, your final point total for this part will be:

$$5 \times \frac{E_i}{E_{max}}$$

## Question 4 (25 pts.)

Now, let's work with **three classes** - 3s, 5s, and 8s. Start by subsetting your training and validation sets to only include 3s, 5s and 8s.

### Part 1 (25 pts.)

Hidden among the 7500 3s, 5s, and 8s in the training set are 20 12 $\times$ 12 pixel images of sandals, sneakers, and ankle boots. These images are taken from another commonly used ML benchmarking data set called "Fashion MNIST". [Fashion MNIST](https://github.com/zalandoresearch/fashion-mnist) is an alternative data set used for classification method benchmarking that has uses pictures of shirts, bags, shoes, etc. rather than images of handwritten digits. Each of the 20 images are shown in the figures below:

![](Shoes1.jpeg)

![](Shoes2.jpeg)

Using everything you've learned about classification methods in this class (and some intuition), come up with a method that finds these images in the training set.  At a minimum, create a plot of the most suspect "digits" that shows your best guesses as to the 20 anomalies.

Your points for this problem will be wholly allocated as a function of your method.  There is **no perfect answer** for this problem.  As long as you put in some effort to find these images, you will get most (if not all) points for this part.  As such, please be sure to clearly explain your approach to this task.  I am eager to see what you all come up with!  This is a really abstract problem, so just try your best.

Note that this is an example of **anomaly detection** - a subset of machine learning algorithms that intend to tell us when something in our data set is weird (or an outlier, if you like to use that kind of terminology).  This is a classification-*esque* problem as it would be easy to solve this if we had some labelled shoe images.  However, this training set doesn't include any appropriately labelled instances.

Notes:

  1. Part of what makes this task so challenging for this particular set of three digits is that 3s, 5s, and 8s look a lot alike!  This would be really easy for 0s and 1s because our classifiers are so well tuned for these digits.  This means that an approach that finds images close to the decision boundary for this classification problem will yield a mixture of really poorly written digits **and** the shoes.  This is a good starting point for creating your own approach, though!  You'll have to get creative to try to find things that really don't look like the other images in the data set.
  
  2. An initial thought may be to use instances from the fashion MNIST data set to train a "shoe/not shoe" classifier.  This will not work out-of-the-box because I have processed all of the original 28 x 28 images down to 12 x 12 images.  You are more than welcome to do this processing yourself if this is the route that you choose (though, I suggest not going this route as it kinda defeats the purpose of this problem).
  
  3. An approach that I highly recommend checking out is called a "one-class SVM".  Implementations of this approach exist in `ksvm` and `sklearn` in Python.  This approach differs from the SVM we covered in class as it uses a parameter `nu` rather than the cost.  Read the documentation on this method and apply it to drastically reduce the number of candidate images!  However, it's not guaranteed to return **all** of the shoe images.  You'll need to do a little work to get the rest.
  
  4. At a certain point, you may just want to use good old human checking to try to sort between bad digit images and shoe images.  Unless you're willing to commit a lot of time to labelling, just going through 7500 images one by one will not work.  However, looking at 30ish wouldn't take too long.  Use classification algorithms to find a few good candidates and sort through those to find your first few "shoe" images.
  
  5.  Once you've found a few shoes, think about creating a classifier.  Trees and SVMs are likely your best best for fitting a decision boundary with only a few observations in one specific class (e.g. just a few shoes).  One thing that will help here is to train a second classifier using a few "prototype" images - 3s, 5s, and 8s that are good examples of the digits and not the chicken-scratch that makes this problem so hard.
  
  6. Without using the knowledge of where the shoe images are, I was able to find 15 of the 20 images.  I, personally, had a hard time re-finding the images of the stiletto sandals because they look a lot like 5s!  
  
  7. I'm really eager to see your approaches here - this is a weird problem that requires a lot of thought.  But, I think that this is a good demonstration of how you might use the approaches we discussed in class to address atypical classification problems.



## Question 5 (20 pts.)

Finally, let's work with the full MNIST data set. This is a 10 class classification problem that has been studied extensively. With your work on this problem, you will join the club of data scientists who have taken a crack at one of machine learning's most infamous classification tasks!

### Part 1 (10 pts.)

Use any tools in our classification arsenal to try to minimize the expected misclassification rate for out of sample handwritten digits.

In your answer, you should benchmark any algorithms that are suited for the problem. For any classification methods that you know will not work well (by virtue of the structure of the data), justify why it's not worth the time to check it. Be sure to explain your method for tuning any hyperparameters.

For any models you run, produce a table that shows the misclassification rate on the validation set. Similarly, record the compute time needed to arrive at your final model (including any hyperparameter tuning) and include this in the same table. See [this StackOverflow thread](https://stackoverflow.com/questions/6262203/measuring-function-execution-time-in-r) for an elementary way to do this in R.

Which model performs the best on the 10 class problem? Why do you think this model performs the best? Compare your approach to other possible approaches when answering this question.

Is the tradeoff in accuracy vs. compute time worth the gain in realistic scenarios? Think about how these algorithms might scale as $N$ and $P$ get larger. Specifically, discuss the problem of hyperparameter tuning and how this might contribute to difficulty in implementing your chosen approach.

For one-off classification problems, the computational time may not matter. However, there is significant research into the area of **online classification algorithms** - algorithms in which new predictions can be made quickly using existing data and the classification algorithm can be updated using new training data as it arrives. See [this Wikipedia page](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Online_machine_learning) for more information on this topic.

**WARNING!**  SVMs will be very competitive on this problem.  However, the compute time needed to train them will be very high.  As always, I expect that you will tune the cost parameter for any SVM.  So, even more compute time!  To mitigate this, you are encouraged to subset the data for SVMs (and trees if you're really running into problems).  I think that a reasonable size is 500 per class.  You can also reduce the number of cost tuning parameters that you check, though I highly recommend trying cost values that are both small, medium (around 1), and large.  Trees are much more scalable, so I think you'll be able to use the full data for those.  

### Part 2 (5 pts.)

For your final model, compute a **confusion matrix** for the validation set that shows how often each digit is classified in each class. Which incorrect classifications happen most frequently?

For the most commonly confused digit pairs, plot examples that are misclassified. What aspect of these images led to their misclassification?

The MNIST data as presented to you has been simplified in some ways. There are also other data cleaning tasks that can improve predictive accuracy. What are some steps that could be taken in the data cleaning stage that would help your chosen method improve its misclassification rate?

### Part 3 (5 pts.)

Use the hidden test set to generate a prediction for each included image. Your predictions should be stored in a matrix that has the image key as the first column and the integer value of the class in the second column. Save this matrix as `Q5Predictions.csv` and include it with your final submission.

Points for this question will be given with respect to classification accuracy. Let $E_i$ be the proportion of observations in the test set misclassified. Let $E_{min}$ be the minimum proportion of misclassified observations across the class. Then, you final point total for this part will be:

$$5 \times \frac{E_{max}}{E_i}$$
